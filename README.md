# JavaScript-Calorie-Counter
In the process of coding a web application, there's often a need to accept input from users. This project on calorie counting serves as a learning opportunity to validate user input, execute calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to show the outcomes.

Through this practice project, you'll grasp fundamental concepts such as regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
